# Clustering-Taxi-Geolocation-Data-To-Predict-Location-of-Taxi-Service-Stations
Taxi Movement Detection using the DBSCAN clustering algorithm.

# Clustering Algorithm
Clustering is done with the DBSCAN algorithm which detects spatiotemporal taxi trip hotspots. The clustered data is then used in a recommendation system that generates optimal GPS routes for taxis that maximizes time driving passengers while minimizing time wasted on the road without serving a passenger. This ensures that taxi drivers can drop off a passenger and quickly pick up a nearby passenger to save time, money, and fuel, while also making sure that passengers can have a taxi as soon as possible.

# Implementation
The project is implemented in four different programming paradigms: objected-oriented, concurrent, logical, and functional programming in Java, Golang, Prolog, and Scheme, respectively. UML diagrams and detailed documentation are also included in the development of this project.
